To date, Violet is able to predict whether or not an egg will successfully fertilize with 90% accuracy, and the chance of it reaching a blastocyst with almost 65% accuracy. These findings have been reproduced and validated in multiple In-Vitro Fertilization clinics and our innovations have been presented at international conferences. \n\nThis significant innovation is used to provide objective insights into the quality of an egg, which will lead to personalized patient feedback, tailored treatment plans, and improved IVF outcomes for patients in future treatments.",

Our mission is to engage customers by fixing all the problems around getting and taking their medications. We've taken the first step by simplifying adherence.\n\nThe Problem: \ndivvyDOSE was founded by a second-generation physician who became frustrated because most chronic diseases can be managed by medications - so long as they are taken at the correct dose and time. However, medication adherence rates drop drastically over time - particularly when medication regimens become more complex (e.g. more prescriptions, more pills, more administration times). Our founder recognizes that healthcare professionals are not immune to this problem in their own practice. The low adherence statistics are due to the poor design of the current prevailing system. To combat this, divvyDOSE uses human-centered design, innovation, and technology.\n\nThe Solution: \nRemove all impediments to adherence including the burden of remembering dosage and timing, coordinating refills, wasting time standing in line at a pharmacy, and confusion between pills. divvyDOSE provides a better user experience with real live people for support all for no extra cost. \n\nFeatures: \ndivvyDOSE is designed to serve people who manage multiple prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Every 30 days, customers receive a personalized roll of pre-sorted prescription medications, vitamins, and OTC medications with clearly-marked dates and times to make managing them easy. We call these divvyPACKS. Any ointments, lotions and inhalers, are included, too. Each delivery includes a divvyLABEL that explains what each pill is and how it should be taken in easy-to-understand language. Customers can email or call their dD pharmacist any time to ask questions or clarify instructions.\n\nFor more information, visit https://divvydose.com/\nFor open divvyTEAM positions, visit https://divvydose.com/careers/\nTo take a look into divvyDOSE, check us out on Glassdoor.",
