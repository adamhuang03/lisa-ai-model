Hi Chris,  
  
Hope you are having a great day.  
  
My name is Adam and I’m a second-year at the University of Toronto. I have an interest in Investment Banking and am completing a 4-month internship at National Bank this winter, in their Toronto office.  
  
I was interested in your experience working with the team at Greenhill and how you came to IB after your experience in Accounting at Linamar. If you had the time, I’d love to meet for coffee to learn a bit about your career journey. I've attached my resume for reference if needed.  
  
I understand you must be busy, so I'd be more than happy to find a time that works best for your schedule.  
  
Looking forward to hearing back!  
  
Best,  
Adam
